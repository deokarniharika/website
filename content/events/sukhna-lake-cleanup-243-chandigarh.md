<p class="text-xl text-left">I was excited about the clean-up because the preparations have started the night before.</p><p>I kept gloves and trash bags along with a water bottle and sanitizer in my backpack so that I don&#39;t forget anything. Then my sister and I started preparing vegan chocolate muffins with all the love in them. I packed them in a container and went to sleep.</p>

<p>My morning alarm rang, and without snoozing, I woke up. I cycled to the lake and messaged the group &quot;Hey, I&#39;m here&quot;. Soon everybody joined, and we started with the clean-up. We did it for 45 minutes and were able to fill two bags with non-biodegradable waste.</p>

<p>When I opened the box of muffins, the sweetness was in the air, which bonded us all together with few waves of laughter.</p>
