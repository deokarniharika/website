<p>This was my first clean-up at Sanjay van with team There Is No Earth B and it was truly gratifying to do my small part for our earth.</p>
<p>It was a fantastic way to start off the day and we all are connected (bandhan) to nature, so it&#39;s our duty to protect (raksha) and save our earth.”</p>
