<p><span class="dropcap">T</span><strong></strong></p><p>his is a statement that is becoming more relevant as time passes. In search of order, we have created chaos in the form of plastic. Leo Baekeland invented Bakelite, the first real synthetic, mass-produced plastic. Ignoring the environmental, social, legal, economic, and political aspects, we focussed on our greed and created different types of plastics (normally varying from 1-7 as mentioned in the back of every plastic product).</p>
<p>NIMBY (NOT IN MY BACKYARD) had become the governing principle of our lives and we littered plastic everywhere not even sparing our rivers. River Yamuna is one of the most polluted rivers and has been called a river that is about to die. The Yamuna requires urgent action for protection.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/thereisnoearthb/">There Is No Earth B</a></strong> is a community that has been working tirelessly to reduce plastic pollution at the banks of Yamuna via the means of cleanup drives for quite some time. They have collected a total of 142.50 kg plastic and 170.83 kg of other non-biodegradable waste in the last 3 drives which I was part of. Time for gratitude is far bygone and action is required from all quarters. Everyone who can, should come and join the drive at least once.&nbsp;</p>

<p>All the equipment is available on site such as gloves, plogging sticks, first-aid kit bags for plastic and other non-biodegradable waste. The team doesn't seek the limelight and yet arranges for everything and brings snacks for us. Lastly, I would like to mention that it is time for us to shift from NIMBY to NIABY (NOT IN ANYBODY'S BACKYARD) before we face the problems that no one can solve&nbsp;</p>
<p>I thank <a href="https://www.twitter.com/thereisnoearthb/">@thereisnoearthb</a> for providing me the opportunity to help them clean one of the most important rivers of the country. Let us keep our environment clean so that it keeps us safe from ourselves.</p>
