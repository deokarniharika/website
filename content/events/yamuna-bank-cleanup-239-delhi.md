<p>Realizing I needed to do more than complain about pollution, I decided to join cleanup initiatives around me, which led me to TINEB.</p>


<p>I joined them for the first time on Saturday at Yamuna Bank. They're a very welcoming community, and we're all united by a common goal, to clean the environment, where language, religion, economic background don't matter. Only one meeting was enough to make some new friends!</p>
<p><br />The cleanup itself was eye-opening, and also very satisfying. To see so much waste (especially styrofoam!! Seriously, where does so much styrofoam come from!!??) just thrown around in and near the Yamuna was extremely sad. It was satisfying, though, to collect and segregate it for recycling and other uses.<br /><br />I enjoyed the experience a lot, and plan to go to many more cleanups in the future. I have already started asking more of my friends to join me. I hope to meet more of the community in the coming months!</p>
