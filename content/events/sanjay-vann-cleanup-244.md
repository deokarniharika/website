<p class="text-xl text-left">â€œI cannot think of a better way to spend my Sunday morning than with the warm people @ <a href="https://www.instagram.com/thereisnoearthb/" tabindex="0">TINEB</a> cleaning up Sanjay Van.</p>

<p>While it was not my first time there, today was a due reminder of the importance of small actions. It made me realize, aptly so on the occasion of Independence Day, that there are a few simple things we can do which are patriotic and of use:</p>

- Throw our trash in the garbage, not out in the street,
- Reduce our usage of plastic,
- Pick up litter while walking or exercising, and
- <a href="https://thereisnoearthb.org/sign-up/">Join in every Sunday</a> for cleanups because There is No Earth B!"
