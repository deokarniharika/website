<p class="text-xl text-left">Minarets, mausoleums, and old bazaars adorn our little city of Lucknow.</p>

<p>For our Independence Day cleanup, big plans were made. But as the day approached and as all of us mortals do with our big plans for big days end up at our homes, so did we.<br />
<br />
Cleaning our colony didn&#39;t seem that remarkable of a feat, or so we thought. We did not expect much, after all, we were not cleaning up some minaret or important public place but we took home a satisfaction almost akin to what we felt as children gobbling up laddoos on each Independence Day.</p>
