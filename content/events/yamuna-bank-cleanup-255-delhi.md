<p class="text-xl text-left">‚ÄúThe experience was amazing and I really had a great time at Yamuna bank's clean-up drive.</p>
<p>I&#39;m grateful for the beautiful day that I had during the clean-up drive. I learned about your community through Rashmi, and believe me, it&#39;s wonderful to know that you care so much about our earth. I loved the feeling of doing something good for my planet, even if it didn&#39;t make a big difference in terms of climate change or global warming, and I thank you for that.<br />
<br />
There, I realized the significance of our environment. The amount of plastic I saw there made me realize that what we&#39;re doing to our planet is unacceptable. In order to make a contribution to preventing climate change and global warming in some way, we need to segregate every piece of trash we throw.</p>

<p>We should not throw out plastic, it is not biodegradable and may suffocate aquatic animals. Our use of plastics and recycling should be kept more in mind at the individual level as much as possible. It&#39;s a great initiative, keep doing such good worküëç</p>

<p>AND yes, Thank you for those muffins and plum sauce it was so yum.‚Äù</p>
