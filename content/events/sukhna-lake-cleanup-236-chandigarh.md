<p class="text-xl text-left">Whenever I am in Chandigarh, I always visit Sukhna Lake, be it early morning to watch the sunrise or in the evening to watch the sunset.</p><p>It gives me a very homely feeling watching the rising or setting sun and Himalayas in the backdrop. And just like me, it attracts a lot of people for various reasons, and some of them leave trash behind.</p>

<p>During this visit, I came across the clean-up drive at Sukhna Lake organized by There is No Earth B and decided to volunteer for the same to do my bit in keeping the area clean to maintain the beauty and tranquility of the surrounding of the lake. We all must do our bit to keep our surroundings clean as There is No Earth B.</p>
