<p class="text-xl text-left">It is 7 A.M., and I must go.</p>

<p>The beloved lake is calling me, calling me to adore its beauty!</p>

<p>The morning breeze hit harder than caffeine, and the plastic pollution makes me ponder - who should be blamed for this?</p>

<p>Entangled in my thoughts, I see a few humans with yellow gloves and a multicolor bag in their hands picking up plastic waste from the lake.</p>

<p>Hesitant at first, I volunteered with enthusiasm!</p>

<p>But now I mull over - is me picking up trash every Sunday going to help the world fight plastic pollution? I shrugged my thought and remembered what my friend once said - if I can save one fish from the sea, I will protect it. So, if I can pick one plastic wrapper from the lake, I will because There Is No Earth B.</p>
