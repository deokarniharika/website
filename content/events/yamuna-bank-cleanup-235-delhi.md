<p>Most of the trash and waste doesn&rsquo;t disappear. A monster or a black hole doesn&rsquo;t eat it up! It ends up amidst the natural world, polluting and harming all aspects of life.</p>

<p>No matter what SOME people might make you believe, flying to Mars is not an option because THERE IS NO EARTH B!</p>

<p>Cleanup drives help in removing non-biodegradable waste from the banks of river Yamuna. It is the need of the hour. More people joining in would mean a larger and stronger impact.</p>

<p>The community ensures that there are gloves, sanitizers, first aid kits, plogging sticks, and snacks! It is a fun place to be at.</p>

<p>It was my first cleanup drive with <a href="https://instagram.com/thereisnoearthb">@thereisnoearthb</a> and honestly, everyone should JOIN IN.”</p>

<p>At cleanup #235 <a href="https://www.instagram.com/shrooti02/">Shruti</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/tanishaglt/">Tanisha</a>, <a href="https://thereisnoearthb.org/sania/">Sania</a>, and Dhrstadyumn&nbsp;removed 6.31kg of plastic and 8.78kg of other non-biodegradable waste.</p>

<p>The collection was handed to the Indian Pollution Control Association</p>

<p>Plastic: 6.31 kg</p>

<p>Other non-biodegradables: 8.78 kg</p>

<p>We&#39;ve removed over 775.53 kg of non-biodegradable waste this year. Please consider <a href="https://thereisnoearthb.org/upi.html">supporting the cause</a> so we can stay on track and reach our&nbsp;goals.&nbsp;</p>
