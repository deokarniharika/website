<p class="text-xl text-left">â€œIt was a long time I met my co-friends cleaning Sukhna Lake.</p><p>Clean-up is always fun, and it keeps me grounded. I feel near to mother nature and myself on the ground keeping aside all the egos and cleaning the surroundings as my own home!</p>

<p>Walker always asks us if we were from a municipal corporation or NGO. No JOHN!!!! We are humans! From a place called earth and we clean it because we stay here. Right here!!!!!! And hope you don&#39;t stay in a dirty home, you clean it, and next time you see us, please don&#39;t ask the same question, you can join us to clean the home you stay in!&rdquo;</p><hr />
