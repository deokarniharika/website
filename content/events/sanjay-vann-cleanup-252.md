<p class="text-xl text-left">“Hi, today was my first clean-up drive at Sanjay van.</p>


<p>My friend actively took part in the drives that took place earlier and told me about the same and I saw your pictures from previous drives and after that really wanted to be part of one.</p><p>I really loved being part of the drive and would definitely continue it in the future. It feels so amazing to be a part team working towards such a wonderful cause.</p>
<p>Hope to see ya all soon in the next drive ☺️”</p>
